# Serverless Dreidel! (https://25daysofserverless.com/calendar/1)
🎶 "I had a little dreidel

I made it out of sand

And when I tried to spin it

It crumbled in my hand!" 🎶

Your first stop is Tel Aviv, Israel, where everybody is concerned about Hanukkah! Not only have all the dreidels been stolen, but so have all of the servers that could replicate spinning a top!

Have no fear, though: you have the capability to spin not only dreidels, but to spin up serverless applications that can spin a dreidel just as well as you can!

Your task for today: create a REST API endpoint that spins a dreidel and randomly returns נ (Nun), ג (Gimmel), ה (Hay), or ש (Shin). This sounds like a great opportunity to use a serverless function to create an endpoint that any application can call!
